Introduction: 
HIV incidence in Malawi is disproportionately higher in women than men. Although the source of this disparity is not well-understood, we hypothesize it may be linked to serial and concurrent heterosexual partnerships as men are 13-fold likely than women to report multiple sexual partners, thus, introducing new transmission pathways. We aimed to identify factors that predict the risk of serial and concurrent sexual partnerships among Malawian men.

Methods: 
We analysed the 2015-16 Malawi DHS prevalence data, comparing men who reported single to multiple non-overlapping (serial) or overlapping (concurrent) sexual partnerships. Bayesian framework was adopted to determine factors that predict the risks of serial and concurrent sexual partnerships, adjusted for clustering by enumeration area and household.

Results: 
Of 5,743 men reporting 1 sexual partnerships 12-months prior to DHS, 4,737 (82.5%), 607 (10.6%), and 399 (6.9%) were in single, serial and concurrent sexual partnerships, respectively. The overall mean age were 31.5 years (standard deviation [SD]: 10.0) during DHS, and 17.7 years (SD 3.7) at sexual debut. The increased absolute risks of serial and concurrent sexual partnerships were driven by men who were >6 months away from home (57.5% and 56.8%), who primed sex in early adolescence (55.0% and 51.0%), or who paid for sex (72.7% and 62.9%). While the absolute risk of serial monogamy was also elevated by younger age (51.7%), concurrent sexual partnerships was prominent in older age (57.1%), in addition to men in primary education (52.5%), or without desire for child bearing (53.5%).

Conclusions: 
We have identified factors that predict the risks of both serial and concurrent sexual partnerships, as well as other factors specific to each outcome. While interventions to reduce the risks of serial and concurrent sexual partnerships may be similar for both outcomes, they need to be distinctively targeted for younger and older generations of men.
